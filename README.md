# Decision Tree and Random Forest Modeling

This repository contains my work on training and evaluating a Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier on a dataset, following the tasks below.

---

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. Load and Prepare Data
- Imported the dataset.
- Checked for missing values.
- Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
- Split data into train/test sets.

### 2. Train Decision Tree Classifier
- Trained Decision Tree with different `max_depth` values.
- Collected train and test accuracies to analyze overfitting.

### 3. Visualize the Decision Tree
- Plotted the tree using `plot_tree` from scikit-learn.

### 4. Interpret Feature Importances
- Displayed feature importances to see which variables influence predictions most.

### 5. Train Random Forest Classifier
- Trained a Random Forest with chosen `max_depth` that is equal to 8.
- Compared Random Forest accuracy with Decision Tree accuracy.

### 6. Evaluate with Cross-Validation
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation to check model stability.
- Compared mean cross-validation scores.
